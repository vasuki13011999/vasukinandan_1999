Tracking objects in both structured and un-structured environments is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision and artificial 
intelligence research. This project introduces a new computer vision-based object tracking for various applications.
object tracking has been driven by increase in power available in both hardware and software. The method uses webcam camera that performs in real
time and also provides an image. In this method system keeps learning about the appearance of the object during real time.

It is related to many real time applications like vehicle perception, video surveillance and so on. In order to overcome the issue of detection,
tracking related to object movement and appearance. Most of the algorithm focuses on the tracking algorithm to smoothen the video sequence. 
On the other hand, few methods use the prior available information about object shape, colour, and texture and so on.





To run the code use the folloewing in the  python command
>> python App.py
